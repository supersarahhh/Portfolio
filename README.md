# User Stories 

As a hiring manager, I'm looking for insight on Sarah as a candidate for hire. 

As a recruiter, I'm seeking to fill the roles open for hire and would like to seee if Sarah will be a good fit. 

As someone who is seeking a career change, I'm seeking inspiration from Sarah's transition as a member of the dev community.

# Unsolved Problems & Hurdles
While I have a fully functioning site, the product as it stands leaves much to be desired. I worked really hard to keep the site clean, consistent, and easy to navigate. However, the content and the display of skill level is not as impressive as I had hoped. And creating a site that is interesting and mobile responsive proved to be a much harder task than I had initially imagined. The site is responsive now, but it's not where I would like it to be. 

# Next Steps
Because this site will essentially become an extension of me on my journey as a developer, I hope to keep iterating on it as I sharpen my toolset. 
In the shorter-term I'd eventually like to 'clean-up' the animations and have it look beautiful on every device possible. 
In the longer-term I hope to add more interesting projects and content about me as my journey progresses in the dev world.
