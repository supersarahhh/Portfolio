            <p style="text-indent: 25px;"> Thanks for visiting my little internet hub! I'm Sarah and this is my story...</p> 
            <p style="text-indent: 25px;">While in college, I majored in Sociology and minored in Global Leadership & Innovation. As you may guess, I've always had a strong curiosity towards systems, how they work, and how we fit into them as humans. I've spent the last 8+ years utilizing my skills in customer facing roles within the SaaS and PaaS space. Over the years I've met so many interesting clients who have built incredible products, and those conversations sparked my interest in development. So here we are! My first step into the world of Software Engineering. Follow along to see my journey! </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">Outside of work, code, and business; I love art and travel. The image laid in the background of each page is a photo that I personally took while traveling to South Korea. The specific art piece is called 'Gravity Stairs' by Olafur Eliasson. It's a schematic of the solar system reflected by mirrors. The work reflects the possibility for coexistence between our various, individual worldviews. And I feel this perfectly describes my intentions and how I see the world. I'm just a person hoping to bridge the gaps between my soft and technical skills. Exploring more ways to find harmony in the way we live. </p>
