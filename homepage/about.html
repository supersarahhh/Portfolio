        <p>Thanks for visiting my little internet hub! I'm Sarah and this is my story. I'm Sociology BA holder with a minor in Global Leadership and Innovation. I've spent the last 7+ years utilizing my skills in the SaaS and PaaS space. And after meeting so many interesting clients over the years, it sparked my interest in development. So here we are! My first step into the world of Software Engineering. </p>
        <p>Follow along to see my journey! </p>
        <p>Outside of work, code, and business; I love art and travel. The image laid in the background of each page is a photo that I personally took while traveling to South Korea. The art piece is called Gravity Stairs by Olafur Eliasson. It's a schematic of the solar system reflected by mirrors. The work reflects the possibility for coexistence between our various, individual worldviews. 
        </p>   
        
        <p>I feel this perfectly demonstrates my intentions and how I see the world. I hope to bridge the gaps between the soft and the technical. And on a personal level, explore more ways to find harmony in the way we live. </p>
